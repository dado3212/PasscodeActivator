#PasscodeActivator

PasscodeActivator is a Cydia tweak for Activator that adds Activator Events for any passcode you type in.

If you want it so that typing in 1234 for your password turns on the Flashlight?  That's possible.  Want a special guest mode enabled with a certain password?  Go for it.  Want an incognito mode where Airplane Mode is on and the volume is off?  Feel free.

To install it, either install from the .deb, or add the repository http://cydia.alexbeals.com to Cydia and download PasscodeActivator.
